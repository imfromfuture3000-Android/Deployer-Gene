Program accounts must be extended with `solana program extend`\n    before an upgrade if they need to accommodate larger programs.\n  * Interface for `gossip_service::get_client()` has changed. `gossip_service::get_multi_client()` has been removed.\n* Upgrade Notes\n  * `solana-program` and `solana-sdk` default to support for Borsh v1, with\nlimited backward compatibility for v0.10 and v0.9. Please upgrade to Borsh v1.\n  * Operators running their own bigtable instances need to create the `entries`\n    table before upgrading their warehouse nodes\n\n## [1.17.0]\n* Changes\n  * Added a changelog.\n  * Added `--use-snapshot-archives-at-startup` for faster validator restarts",
